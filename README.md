Shire is a blog-aware static site generator modelled around the famous [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It also tends to pull in features from the [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress). The project is under heavy development as this also serves my [home site](http://www.sangupta.com) :)

Usage
-----

The project is still under development and hence, it may not be usable directly via the command line. 

To use sync the code base and set it up as a project in your favorite IDE. Shire is a Maven-based JAVA project. Once the project is setup, open the JAVA class `Shire` and in the `main` method, setup the path to your YAML config file.
